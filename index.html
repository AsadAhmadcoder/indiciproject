                    <p>
                        Recognising that emerging models of out-of-hospital care would need to be
                        all-inclusive, from the outset we embarked on a strategy to progressively develop a
                        comprehensive suite of integrated software products to enable the delivery of joined-up
                        ‘converged care’ regardless of location.

                        During the past ten years, and working in close collaboration with care practitioners
                        internationally, we have successfully created a unique portfolio of enterprise-level
                        out-of-hospital systems that seamlessly operate across emergency medical services, urgent &
                        unplanned care, community care and supported living.

                        Whilst patient care is core to our software, experience has taught us that out-of-hospital care
                        providers have deeply-interlinked business and operational dependencies. Reflecting these needs,
                        our products additionally address operational, revenue assurance and compliance requirements in
                        customer organisations.

                    <p>An unswerving commitment to quality and excellence in the products and
                        services
                        that we provide to our customers and, ultimately, to the patients and clients they serve, is a
                        core strand of Indici corporate DNA.

                        We operate quality management and information security programmes in accordance with
                        international standards ISO9001:2015 and ISO27001:2013 respectively. These programmes are
                        complemented by our continuous review of all aspects of performance and procedures in every part
                        of our business.

                        As our staff are key to quality and excellence, we continually invest in staff training and
                        development and in customer engagement and relationship management.

                        All Indici solution implementations and support services are governed by best-in-breed
                        project management methodologies and by international software industry practice standards.

                        The quality and excellence in Indici products and services also reflects our proud track record
                        of continuous investment in research and development to create innovative, world-class solutions
                        that are increasingly shaping how healthcare is delivered outside of hospital settings.</p>
